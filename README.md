# Tint Site

Tint Site is a web application created as a pitch for a tinting business. Although it was not ultimately used by the intended owner due to franchise requirements, the site showcases a professional and visually appealing design. The future plan for this project is to transform it into a versatile blank layout that can be customized for any business in need of a simple website.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Tint Site features a responsive design, ensuring a seamless browsing experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Form Submission**: The site includes a form that allows users to submit their information. The form data is linked to a Google Spreadsheet, ensuring that all customer information can be easily saved and accessed.

- **Google Maps Integration**: Tint Site utilizes the Google Maps API to display the location of the business. This feature provides potential customers with a visual representation of the business's address.

- **Real-time Reviews**: Originally, the site pulled in Google Reviews in real-time to showcase customer feedback. However, due to the project not being in use, the Google Reviews API was not utilized. Instead, a small database of reviews is displayed on the page.
